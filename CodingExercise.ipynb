    "# <u> Coding Workshop - Weighing supermassive black holes\n",

    "Author: Dr Carolin Villforth\n",
    "    \n",
    "Astronomical research often used coding to analyse data, work with large datasets or simulate the Universe. In this notebook, we will weigh a supermassive black hole using coding as a tool. We want to show you how coding is used in research and teach you about supermassive black hole masses as we go along. For those who are inspired to explore the science or coding further, there are links throughout.\n",
    "    \n",
    "In this Jupyter notebook, we will go through the simple basics of coding and how we can use coding to do science. We will be using [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/), which use the programming language [Python](https://www.python.org/). Python is used very widely in astronomy, and many large institutions like the [Hubble Space Telescope (HST)](https://hubblesite.org/), [LIGO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIGO) and others use Python to analyze their data. Python is also easy to learn and very popular [outside of astrophysics](https://realpython.com/world-class-companies-using-python/).\n",

    "## Why we use coding in science\n",
    "\n",
    "Coding is now a central in much of research, here we want to show you some simple steps. By the end of this notebook, you will have measured the mass of a black hole and visualized the properties of a large sample of black holes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, [coding - or programming-](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming) refers to designing a computer program that performs calculations or executes tasks. For example, we might write code to perform a large number of calculations faster than could be done in your head or using a calculator. Alternatively, we might use coding to control equipment, such as telescopes! To achieve this, we need to write down instructions to the computer how the calculations or tasks should be executed. We do this using a programming language, that is a language the computers will understand. There are a range of different programming languages out there, which differ in their syntax (which is a bit like grammar) and the tasks they are good at. Many of the principles however are similar across languages, so learning one makes it easier to learn others. Here we will be using [Python](https://www.python.org/), which is very popular in science. In astrophysics, we use coding for...\n",
    "\n",
    "- <b>dealing with large datasets</b>: many of our datasets contain millions of objects, we need coding to perform even simple calculations. An example is the [Sloan Digital Sky Survey](https://www.sdss.org/) which has surveyed over half of the sky and mapped millions of galaxies and accretion black holes (we will be using some of this data ourselves very soon!).\n",
    "\n",
    "- <b>performing complex calculations</b>: the Universe is extremely large, and the physics involved for example in galaxy evolution is very complex and we need to take into account a lot of difficult physics. Simulations of the Universe require many months on extremely powerful supercomputers to perform such complex simulations. Examples of such powerful calculations of the entire Universe include [IllustrisTNG](https://www.tng-project.org/), [EAGLE](http://icc.dur.ac.uk/Eagle/index.php), [Horizon](https://www.horizon-simulation.org/about.html) and others. You can find many great videos of the evolving universe on the linked pages, for example [here](http://www.tng-project.org/movies/tng/tng300_most_massive_cluster_gas_1080p.mp4)\n",
    "\n",
    "- <b>visualizing data</b>: as we have already mentioned, we often have access to very large datasets and need to show them in figures, we can also do this using programming, and will do so below. Some cool visualizations include [this \"flythrough\" of the universe](http://www.sdss3.org/press/dr9.php) and [an exoplanet visualization](https://www.ianww.com/blog/2013/03/25/kepler-exoplanet-visualization/).\n",

Supermassive black holes have masses of millions to billions times the mass of our own sun, which itself weights $2\\times10^{30}$kg. We know of supermassive black holes mainly when they actively accrete, i.e. when matter falls in and lights up. If you want to learn more about the background science, you can watch a short 15min talk [here](https://youtu.be/4wcTbRn3gNM).

In particular, the electrons in these atoms exist at discrete [energy levels](https://skyserver.sdss.org/dr1/en/proj/advanced/spectraltypes/energylevels.asp), which are restricted by quantum mechanics. Electrons can drop energy levels, emitting a photon at the exact wavelength corresponding to the energy gap between the levels. Atoms can also absorb photons of the appropriate wavelength to raise an electron to a higher energy level. These processes form the basis of [spectral lines](http://skyserver.sdss.org/dr1/en/proj/advanced/spectraltypes/lines.asp), which appear at characteristic wavelengths for different types of atom (for example, [hydrogen](https://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/b/Balmer+series)).\n",

    "We would expect spectral lines to be infinitely thin, existing at only one specific wavelength, but this is clearly not the case for our black hole spectrum. As the gas clouds orbit the black hole, the wavelengths of their spectral lines are changed due to the [Doppler effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doppler_effect), which shortens the wavelength of light emitted by an object moving towards the observer and lengthens the wavelength from an object moving away:\n",
